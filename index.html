<p><strong>What happens when you include import java.util.Scanner; in your code?
  Where does this functionality come from? What is the java in java.util.Scanner;?</strong></p>
<p>The statement java.util.Scanner; allows you to accept input from the termianal or different sources.
  It basically means to import Scanner class which is in a util folder, inside the java folder.
  The use of it so far, has been to accept information from the keyboard into your program.
  There are other methods of input with this utility other than the keyboard, but I have not put any of them to
  the test at this stage.</p>

  <p><strong>To generate a random number you use Math.random();? What is Math? What is the return type of the .random()
    method.  Why is the M in Math capitalized?</strong></p>
    <p>Math. is capitalized in java because its a class.  The .random is the function - you can have other
      extensions after Math such as Math.sqrt( this would give you the square root of the value).  Basically, all Math.random does
      is generate a random double with a positive sign in the range of greater than 0.0 and less than 1.0. Because these numbers are
      rarely of use we can add or subtract to them to give us a specific range of randomly generated numbers to be used.</p>

      <p><strong>What is your ultimate goal in attending Skill Distillery? How are you going to achieve it? What is your big why?</strong></p>
    To learn a new skill that allows me to not only get a job, but have a career.  Its exciting to wake up and know that
    I am going to learn something new today!</p>

    <p><strong>When you get frustrated and discouraged what do you do? How can you keep your confidence up and encourage yourself
      during the program?</strong></p>   Frustration? Discouragement?  What are those???  I am the queen of telling myself I can't do
      something.  I am my own worst enemy!  What keeps me going... simple.. I serve a big God, and
      if He brings it to you, He will get you through it! I will just keep looking up!  </p>

      <p><strong>What pitfalls have you encountered when trying to learn new skills or accomplish your goals in the past? How are you
        going to avoid them this time? How are you keeping yourself accountable (who is keeping you accountable)?</strong></p> As stated on the last
        question... I am my own worst enemy!  I know that, but it still doesn't keep me from doubting myself a lot! The Lord has once again
        provided for me on this!  He has not only provided me with the skills and talents to be successful, He also gave me a very supportive husband
        to help me get through anything! </p>
